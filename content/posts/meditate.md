Meditation can enhance your life; it benefits your mind and body while also having a powerful effect on your health.

Researchers at Harvard Medical School discovered that, in long-term practitioners of relaxation methods such as yoga and meditation, far more ''disease-fighting genes'' were active, compared to those who practiced no form of relaxation (Food Matters).‚Äù

There are many different types of meditation to choose from. Below is a description of four of the most popular techniques.

_Mindfulness Meditation_: Focus on an object such as your breathing, thoughts, or sounds. This type of meditation focuses on concentration and awareness.

_Guided Meditation_: Use a recorded tape or in-person guidance. Eventually the need for the guidance will disappear. The teacher uses guided imagery to help put your mind at peace.

_Concentrative Meditation_: Focus on a single object, such as an image, your breathing or a candles flame. When your mind steers off of the object, train your mind to re-focus.

_Open Awareness_: Opening your mind to what is going on around you without specifically focusing on one particular thing.

Now that we understand some of the many types of meditation, we can look further into the reasons why you should meditate.
