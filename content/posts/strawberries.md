# Why you should add more strawberries to your diet

If you’re not already a fan of strawberries, you should be. Not only are they juicy, summery and delicious, they’re a bona fide superfood, too. Nutrient-rich and packed with antioxidants (like vitamin C), the benefits of strawberries are endless, and some will even surprise you. (Wrinkle-prevention? Yes please!).

Below are 10 strawberry benefits you don’t want to miss out on, and don’t miss these strawberry recipes that’ll sweeten up your summer.

# 1. Give your immunity a boost

“Strawberries are an excellent source of vitamin C,” says Toronto-based registered dietitian Madeleine Edwards. Most mammals – except for humans – have the ability to produce vitamin C naturally, which is why it’s so important to get your daily requirement. “One serving contains 51.5 mg of vitamin C — about half of your daily requirement,” Edwards says. “Double a serving to one cup and get 100 percent.” Vitamin C is a well-known immunity booster, as well as a powerful, fast-working antioxidant. Here are other foods high in vitamin C.

# 2. Maintain your healthy vision

The antioxidant properties in strawberries may also help to prevent cataracts — the clouding over of the eye lens — which can lead to blindness in older age. Our eyes require vitamin C to protect them from exposure to free-radicals from the sun’s harsh UV rays, which can damage the protein in the lens. Vitamin C also plays an important role in strengthening the eye’s cornea and retina. (Here are other foods to eat for healthy eyes.)

While high doses of vitamin C have been found to increase the risk of cataracts in women over 65, researchers from the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm note that the risk pertains to vitamin C obtained from supplements, not the vitamin C from fruits and vegetables.

# 3. Keep your wrinkles at bay

The power of vitamin C in strawberries continues, as it is vital to the production of collagen, which helps to improve skin’s elasticity and resilience. Since we lose collagen as we age, eating foods rich in vitamin C may result in healthier, younger-looking skin. But vitamin C isn’t the only naturally-occuring wrinkle fighter found in this fruit. Researchers at Hallym University in the Republic of Korea concluded that ellagic acid visibly prevented collagen destruction and inflammatory response — two major factors in the development of wrinkles — in human skin cells, after continued exposure to skin-damaging UV-B rays. Here’s what your face wrinkles are trying to tell you.

# 4. Lower your cholesterol

According to the Heart and Stroke Foundation, heart disease is one of the leading causes of death among Canadian women. Luckily, the benefits of strawberries include powerful heart-health boosters. “Ellagic acid and flavonoids — or phytochemical — can provide an antioxidant effect that can benefit heart health in various ways,” explains Edwards. “One way includes counteracting the effect of low-density lipoprotein, or LDL — bad cholesterol in the blood, which causes plaque to build up in arteries. A second way is that they provide an anti-inflammatory effect, which is also good for the heart.”

Researchers at the Clinical Nutrition and Risk Factor Modification Center in Toronto studied the benefits of strawberries on a cholesterol-lowering diet and concluded that adding them to the diet reduced oxidative damage, as well as blood lipids — both of which play a role in heart disease and diabetes.
