Out of all the animals in the world, why are cats number 1 when it comes to human-animal bonding? Have you ever taken a moment to wonder why we love the feline race so much?

What is it that makes us feel so good when we interact with our cat? Is there more to it than just an emotional connection with our feline buddies? It turns out, YES. And science can prove it.

Here are 7 AMAZING reasons why humans are so fond of our feline friends…

# 1. They speak to you

A cat’s meow isn’t just for display. It’s your cat’s way of having a conversation with you; telling you about their day, asking you what’s for dinner, when the next cuddle time is.

Cats only meow at humans; this vocal communication is reserved especially for you. Not only does this ‘cat language’ help you bond with your cat, but it also means you always have a paw-some buddy to chat to.

# 2. They are cleaning machines

Baths are rarely welcomed by pets, which is why a cat’s self-cleaning nature is a very good thing!

Cats are designed to keep themselves clean, and they are experts at it. Healthy and happy cats clean themselves regularly — a normal cat can spend up to 50% of their day grooming — resulting in one very pristine feline.

# 3. They’re chilled

An average day for a cat involves 18–20 hours of sleeping — that’s a lot of downtime!

In general, cats are very easy-going pets. Essentially, they’re your perfect Sunday partner — willing to lie next to you all day whilst you binge your favorite Netflix show.

# 4. Petting them feels good

After a long stressful day, snuggling up with your kitty and petting their velvety fur can be just the thing to help you relax and unwind. How? Scientists claim there are 3 reasons behind this feel-good action.

First, you’re interacting positively with an animal. Second, you’re moving in a steady, rhythmic way as your hand strokes kitty’s fur — hmmm, relaxing. Third, you’re devoting at least partial attention to this calming activity.

To return the favor and make your kitty feel great when you pet them, concentrate on the areas behind their ears and eyes, as well as around their cheeks and chin.

# 5. They help you release the love hormone

Research has proven that petting a cat causes a release of the “love hormone” in humans.

The technical term for this neurochemical is oxytocin, a hormone that is released when people fall in love. Oxytocin has also been proven to increase your emotional perception!

This allows you to better connect to people and reduce anxiety. Ahh, cat therapy.
